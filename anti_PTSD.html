            <p>The main treatments for people with PTSD are psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two.
                Everyone is
                different, so a treatment that works for one person may not work for another. Some people may need to
                try
                different
                treatments to find what works best for their symptoms. Regardless of what treatment option you chose, it
                is
                important for anyone with PTSD to be treated by a mental health professional who is experienced with
                PTSD.

                Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT):
            </h1>
            <p></p>
            CBT is a type of psychotherapy that has consistently been found to be the most effective treatment of PTSD
            both
            in
            the short term and the long term. CBT for PTSD is trauma-focused, meaning the trauma event(s) are the center
            of
            the
            treatment. It focuses on identifying, understanding, and changing thinking and behavior patterns. CBT is an
            active
            treatment involved the patient to engage in and outside of weekly appointments and learn skills to be
            applied to
            their symptoms. The skills learned during therapy sessions are practiced repeatedly and help support symptom
            improvement. CBT treatments traditionally occur over 12 to 16 weeks.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Main Components of CBT:
            </h1>
            <p>
                While different CBTs have different amounts of both exposure and cognitive interventions, they are the
                main
                components of the larger category of CBTs that have been repeatedly found to result in symptom
                reduction.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Exposure therapy.</h3> This type of intervention helps people face and control their fears by
                exposing
                them
                to the
                trauma
                memory they experiences in the context of a safe environment. Exposure can use mental imagery,
                writing,
                or
                visits to
                places or people that remind them of their trauma. Virtual reality (creating a virtual environment
                to
                resemble
                the
                traumatic event) can also be used to expose the person to the environment that contains the feared
                situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Virtual reality. </h3>Like other exposure techniques can assist in exposures for treatment for PTSD
                when
                the
                technology
                is available. Regardless of the method of exposure, a person is often gradually exposed to the
                trauma to
                help
                them
                become less sensitive over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Cognitive Restructuring. </h3>This type of intervention helps people make sense of bad memories.
                Oftentimes
                people
                remember their trauma differently than how it happened (e.g., not remembering certain parts of the
                trauma,
                remembering it is a disjointed way). It is common for people to feel guilt of shame about aspects of
                their
                trauma
                that were not actually their fault. Cognitive restructuring helps people look at what happened with
                fact
                to
                get
                a
                realistic perspective on the trauma.

                <h3>What is CBT? Listen to this podcast.</h3>

                It is important for anyone with PTSD to be treated by a mental health care professional who is
                experienced
                with
                PTSD. Some people will need to try different treatments to find what works for their symptoms.

                Description of Specific CBTs for PTSD:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a form of CBT that utilizes cognitive therapy to evaluate and
                change
                trauma
                related thoughts. CPT focuses on the way people view themselves, others, and the world after
                experiencing a
                trauma.
                Often times inaccurate thoughts after a trauma keep you stuck and prevent recovery from trauma. In CPT
                you
                look
                at
                why the trauma occurred and the impact it has had on the persons beliefs. CPT focuses on learning skills
                to
                evaluate
                whether you thoughts are supported by facts and if there are more helpful ways to think about your
                trauma.
                There
                is
                strong research support showing CPTs effectiveness across a wide range of traumas.
                Prolonged Exposure (PE) is another form of CBT that relies more heavily on behavioral therapy techniques
                to
                help
                individuals gradually approach trauma related memories, situations, and emotions. PE focuses on
                exposures to
                help
                people with PTSD stop avoiding trauma reminders. Avoiding these reminders may help in the short term,
                but in
                the
                long term it prevents recovery from PTSD. PE uses imaginal exposures, which involve recounting the
                details
                of
                the
                trauma experience, as well as in vivo exposures, which involve repeatedly confronting trauma-related
                situations
                or
                people in their life that they have been avoiding. There is strong research support showing PEs
                effectiveness
                across
                a wide range of traumas.</p>
            <p>
                Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy that involves processing
                upsetting
                trauma-related memories, thoughts and feelings. EMDR asks people to pay attention to either a sound or a
                back
                and
                forth movement while thinking about the trauma memory. This treatment has been found to be effective for
                treating
                PTSD, but some research has shown that the back and forth movement is not the active treatment component
                but
                rather
                the exposure alone is.</p>
            <p>
                Stress Inoculation Training (SIT) is another type of CBT that aims to reduce anxiety by teaching coping
                skills
                to
                deal with stress that may accompany PTSD. SIT can be used as a standalone treatment or may be used with
                another
                types of CBTs. The main goal is to teach people to react differently to react differently to their
                symptoms.
                This is
                done through teaching different types of coping skills including, but is not limited to, breathing
                retraining,
                muscle relaxation, cognitive restructuring, and assertiveness skills. There is modest research support
                showing
                PEs
                effectiveness across a wide range of traumas.</p>
            <h3>
                Other PTSD Treatments:
            </h3>
            <p>
                There are other types of PTSD interventions that are not considered CBTs.

                Present Centered Therapy (PCT) is a type of non-trauma focused treatment that centers around current
                issues
                rather
                than directly processing the trauma. PCT provides psychoeducation about the impact of trauma on oneâ€™s
                life
                as
                well
                as teaching problem solving strategies to deal with current life stressors.

                Medications:

            <p>Medication commonly used to treat PTSD are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</p>
